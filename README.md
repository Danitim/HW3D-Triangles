# HW3D-triangles
Implementation of algorithm, finding collisions between 3D-triangles by geometry modulating them.

# Testing
- Create build folder and go there `mkdir build && cd build`
- Run cmake builder command for the directory above `cmake ..`
- Run makefile command `make`
- Run `./main` to access main algorithm (or run `./geo_tests` or `./isect_tests` to check unit-tests results)

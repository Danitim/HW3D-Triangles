# HW3D-triangles
Implementation of algorithm, finding collisions between 3D-triangles by geometry modulating them.

# Installation
WIP

# Testing
- Create build folder and go there `mkdir build && cd build`
- Run cmake builder command for the directory above `CMake ..`
- Run makefile command `make`
- Run any testing executable, made by `make`

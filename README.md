# HW3D-triangles
Implementation of algorithm, finding collisions between 3D-triangles by geometry modulating them.

# Testing
1. Clone git repository `git clone "HTTPS or SSH"`
2. Go to the project root directory (usually `cd HW3D-Triangles`)
3. Initialize googletest submodule with `git submodule init` and `git submodule update`
4. Create build folder and go there `mkdir build && cd build`
5. Run cmake builder command for the directory above `cmake ..`
6. Run makefile command `make`
7. Run `./main` to access main algorithm (or run `./geo_tests` or `./isect_tests` to check unit-tests results)

The relative position of two triangles in three-dimensional space can be quite varied, and below are the main possible options:

1. **Do not intersect**:
    * Located far from each other.
    * They are nearby, but do not touch or intersect.

2. **Intersect**:
    * One or more edges of one triangle intersect another triangle.
    * The vertex of one triangle is inside the other, but its edges do not intersect with the other triangle.

3. **Touching**:
    * One or more vertices of one triangle touch the plane of another.
    * The edges of one triangle touch the edges or plane of another.
  
4. **Partially coincide**:
    * Two triangles have a common edge or vertex.
    * One part of one triangle lies on the plane of another triangle.

5. **Completely coincide**: 
    * Two triangles lie in the same plane and have the same vertices and edges.

6. **Parallel**:
    * The planes on which the triangles lie are parallel to each other, but the triangles do not touch or intersect.

7. **Perpendicular**:
    * The planes on which the triangles lie form a right angle.

8. **Form an arbitrary angle**:
    * The planes of triangles intersect at an arbitrary angle different from 0°, 90° and 180°.

9. **Nested**:
    * One triangle is completely in the plane of the other and lies within its boundaries.
